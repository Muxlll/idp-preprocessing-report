Machine learning algorithms are gaining more and more importance in many application fields. Also in agriculture, artificial intelligence can be used to improve certain workflows by making them more efficient. 

In this report, a preprocessing algorithm for sugar beet plant detection is presented. It is part of a machine learning pipeline to predict the hail damage of plants in sugar beet fields. The goal of this preprocessing step is to standardize the images taken with the mobile application to improve the results of the damage prediction. 

The used model is YOLO, a state of the art object detection algorithm. Different aspects of training are compared and results of detecting sugar beet plants are presented. In the end, a discussion and outlook summarize the general problems and potential next steps of this project.
