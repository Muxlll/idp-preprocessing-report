All in all, in this project was built a preprocessing algorithm as part of a complete machine learning pipeline to predict the hail damage of sugar beets. With this step, the images taken in the mobile application are cropped in a standardized way to improve the damage prediction value. Further steps could be to train the models for different plants such as wheat if needed. \\

Other ideas to improve the models would be to use newer versions of YOLO such as YOLOv6/ YOLOv7. This is an emerging field with very fast development of new feature and more robust models. One such thing is pose detection.
